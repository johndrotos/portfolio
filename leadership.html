									<h3>Double Discovery Center Residential Coordinator</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/DDC Pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Last summer, I worked as a Residential Coordinator at the Double Discovery Center at Columbia University, where I helped run the center's Summer Academy.
										I prepared first-generation students from low income and under-resourced communities with the skills necessary to succeed in a college environment, and
										I ensured the well-being and safety of all students. I also facilitated communication among all Summer Academy stakeholders including students
										and their families, DDC staff, and Columbia staff. The Summer Academy was a big success, and I am proud to have helped provide the students with a fulfilling and 
										rewarding pre-college experience.

									<h3>Lacrosse</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Lacrosse Pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										I am proud to be captain and treasurer of the Columbia Men's Lacrosse club, an organization I have been playing with since freshman year.
										As captain I have helped grow the team from an loosely organized group of players to a cohesive, successful team, and I am extremely proud 
										of all that we have accomplished. Last season, I <a href="https://www.insidelacrosse.com/article/drotos-game-winner-seals-2024-ivy-league-club-tournament-for-columbia/63261"
										led the team to victory at the Ivy League Club Tournament></a>, and I am eagerly looking forward to building upon our success this year.
