									<h2>Embedding Matrix Evolution in Vision Transformers</h2>
									<a class="image main"><img src="images/GILMLAB Summer Poster.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Last summer, I worked at the <a href="https://coreytolerfranklin.com/gilmlab/"> Graphics Imaging and Light Measurement Lab</a> 
										at Columbia University with Professor Corey Toler-Franklin and a graduate
										student team developing a novel vision transformer architecture for tumor detection in medical slides. My role
										this summer was to run an experiment to better understand how transformers learned during the fine tuning process when trained on 
										our medical data, and I did so by generating comparisons of the embedding matrices before and after fine-tuning. My experiment
										dissected a technology that is typically regarded as a black-box, and my results provided the team with a much better
										understanding of the inner workings of the models we are attempting to improve upon. I am happily continuing my work with
										the lab this fall.
									</p>
									<h4>Technical Skills</h4>
									<p> 
										- Used the open-source framework <a href="https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection">MMDetection</a> in a Docker container on
										an AWS instance to train and test models <br />
										-  Visualized data using Pandas and MatPlotLib
									</p>
									<h4>Non-Technical Skills</h4>
									<p>
										- Designed a poster to present my research at the Columbia Undergraduate Research Symposium on October 25, 2024 <br />
										- I was responsible for teaching myself the entire open-source framework and teaching other members of the lab how to use it
