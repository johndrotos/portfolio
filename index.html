									<h2>Embedding Matrix Evolution in Vision Transformers</h2>
									<a class="image main"><img src="images/GILMLAB Summer Poster.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Last summer, I had the opportunity to work at the <a href="https://coreytolerfranklin.com/gilmlab/">Graphics Imaging and Light Measurement Lab</a> 
										at Columbia University, under the mentorship of Professor Corey Toler-Franklin. Alongside a graduate student team, I contributed to the development 
										of a novel vision transformer architecture designed for tumor detection in medical slides. My primary responsibility was to conduct an experiment 
										aimed at understanding how transformers learn during the fine-tuning process when trained on our medical dataset. I achieved this by generating 
										and analyzing comparisons of the embedding matrices before and after fine-tuning. My research provided valuable insights into the internal 
										mechanisms of the models, which are often seen as black-box technologies, and greatly enhanced the team's understanding of the models we're 
										improving. I am excited to continue working with the lab this fall.</p>
									<h4>Technical Skills</h4>
									<ul> 
										<li>Utilized the open-source <a href="https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection">MMDetection</a> framework within a Docker container on AWS to train and test models</li> 
										<li>Visualized and analyzed data using Pandas and Matplotlib</li> 
									</ul>
									<h4>Non-Technical Skills</h4>
									<ul> 
										<li>Designed a research poster to present at the Columbia Undergraduate Research Symposium in October 2024</li> 
										<li>Independently learned the open-source framework and trained other lab members on how to use it</li> 
									</ul>

										<h2>NBA Prediction APP</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Pic of Betting ML Model.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As a personal project, I am developing a machine learning model to predict the point spreads of regular season NBA games. I collected data from the 
										last 15 years using a <a href="https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-basketball">public API</a> and used Pandas for extensive feature engineering. 
										Some of the features I engineered include season averages, rolling averages, win streaks, home/road performance metrics, and head-to-head matchup 
										statistics. I have implemented and tested both a Random Forest model and a neural network to make predictions. While my results are still in the 
										improvement phase, I am refining my models to enhance their accuracy.</p>
									<h4>Technical Skills</h4>
									<ul> 
										<li>Extracted and processed 15 years of NBA game data from a <a href="https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-basketball">public API</a></li> 
										<li>Performed feature engineering using Pandas to create season and rolling averages, win streaks, and head-to-head statistics</li> 
										<li>Developed and tested machine learning models, including a Random Forest and neural network built with TensorFlow</li>
